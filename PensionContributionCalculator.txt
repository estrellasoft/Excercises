/*Both the employer and the employee are mandated to contribute a certain percentage of the employee's salary towards the employee's pension fund. The rate is tabulated as follows:
        Employee's Age 	Employee Rate (%) 	Employer Rate (%)
        55 and below 	    20 	                17
        above 55 to 60 	    13 	                13
        above 60 to 65 	    7.5 	            9
        above 65 	        5 	                7.5

        However, the contribution is subjected to a salary ceiling of $6,000. In other words, if an employee earns $6,800, only $6,000 attracts employee's and employer's contributions, the remaining $800 does not.

        Write a program called PensionContributionCalculator that reads the monthly salary and age (in int) of an employee. Your program shall calculate the employee's, employer's and total contributions (in double); and print the results rounded to 2 decimal places. For examples,

        Enter the monthly salary: $3000
        Enter the age: 30
        The employee's contribution is: $600.00
        The employer's contribution is: $510.00
        The total contribution is: $1110.00*/
